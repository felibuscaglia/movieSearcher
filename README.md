# Movie Searcher App

##### Deployed application: https://felibuscaglia.github.io/movieSearcher/

This is an IMDB-inspired web application. Using OMDB Web API, React and Redux, I developed a sort of movie database, where you can search for whatever film you like and you receive detailed information about it. If you don't exactly know what you are looking for, you can always search for keywords (e.g 'Batman') and you'll get a list of movies that include that keyword on their titles.

You have the possibility to add your favourite movies to a list that you can access whatever you want, so you keep a track of them. You just have to hover over the film poster and click on the ADD TO FAVOURITE button. Then, if you click on the top right corner button you will have your favourite movies stored.

If you want to access detailed information about the feature (such as it's genre, length, release date, director, etc), you just need to click on the other button that appears when you hover over the movie poster. Then, you will be redirected to the movie detail component.
